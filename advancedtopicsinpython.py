#In this lesson, wel'll cover some of the more complex aspects of Python, including iterating over data structures, list comprehensions, list slicing, and lambda expressions.

#a dictionary is just a collection of keys and values.
d = {"Name": "Guido","Age": 56,"BDFL": True}
print(d)
print(d.items()) #items() function returns an array of tuples with each tuple consisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary
print(d["Name"])

my_dict = {"Name": "Raymond Mar","Hobby": "board games", "Favorite Number": 40}
print(my_dict)
print(my_dict.items()) #items() function returns an array of tuples with each tuple consisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary
print(my_dict["Name"])

#The keys() function returns an array of the dictionary's keys
#The values() function returns an array of the dictionary's values
#these functions will not return the keys or values from the dictionary in any specific order.
#You can think of a tuple as an immutable (that is, unchangeable) list (though this is an oversimplification); tuples are surrounded by ()s and can contain any data type.
my_dict = {"Name": "Raymond Mar","Hobby": "board games", "Favorite Number": 40}
print(my_dict)
print(my_dict.keys())
print(my_dict.values())

#For iterating over lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings, Python also includes a special keyword: in
for number in range(5):
    print(number) #prints 0 1 2 3 4 in their own line
e = { "name": "Eric", "age": 26 }
for key in e:
    print(key, e[key]) #prints name Eric, another line, age 26
for letter in "Eric":
    print(letter) #prints E r i c in their own line
my_dict = {"Name": "Raymond Mar","Hobby": "board games", "Favorite Number": 40}
for eachkey in my_dict:
	print(eachkey, my_dict[eachkey])

#List comprehensions are a powerful way to generate lists using the for/in and if keywords we've learned.
evens_to_50 = [i for i in range(51) if i % 2 == 0]
print(evens_to_50) #prints list 0 to 50 even numbers

#new_list = [x for x in range(1,6)] # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#doubles_by_3 = [x*2 for x in range(1,6) if (x*2)%3 == 0] # => [6]

print(even_squares)

c = ['C' for x in range(5) if x < 3]
print(c) #prints three C in a list ['C', 'C','C']
#The comprehension should consist of the cubes of the numbers 1 through 10 only if the cube is evenly divisible by four.
cubes_by_four = [x**3 for x in range(1,11) if (x**3) % 4 == 0]
print(cubes_by_four)

#List slicing allows us to access elements of a list in a concise manner. The syntax looks like this: [start:end:stride], where start describes where the slice starts (inclusive), end is where it ends (exclusive), and stride describes the space between items in the sliced list.
l = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]
# Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
print(l[2:9:2]) #prints [9, 25, 49, 81]

#If you don't pass a particular index to the list slice, Python will pick a default.
to_five = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
print(to_five[3:]) # prints ['D', 'E'] 
print(to_five[:2]) # prints ['A', 'B']
print(to_five[::2]) # print ['A', 'C', 'E']
#Use list slicing to print out every odd element of my_list from start to finish.
my_list = []

	my_list.append(eachnumber)

#A positive stride progresses through the list from left to right.

	my_list.append(eachnumber)
backwards = (my_list[::-1])
print(backwards)

#A stride length of 1 traverses the list "by ones," a stride length of 2 traverses the list "by twos," and so on.

#functional programming allows to pass functions around just as if they were variables or values.
#see lambda
#lambda x: x % 3 == 0 is the same as: def by_three(x): return x % 3 == 0
#we don't need to actually give the function a name; it does its work and returns a value without one. That's why the function the lambda creates is an anonymous function
#When we pass the lambda to filter, filter uses the lambda to determine what to filter, and the second argument (my_list, which is just the numbers 0 â€“ 15) is the list it does the filtering on.
my_list = []
for eachnumber in range(1,16):
	my_list.append(eachnumber)
print(my_list)
print(filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)) #supposed to print [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15]

#Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you.
#If you plan on creating a function you'll use over and over, you're better off using def and giving that function a name.
